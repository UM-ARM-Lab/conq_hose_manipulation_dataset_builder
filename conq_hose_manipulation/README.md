# Conq Hose Manipulation Dataset

Images are collected from all cameras asynchronously, and the timing may not be precise.
Again, you should be aware that the images and state do not all align perfectly.

The code for generating and visualizing the original dataset can be found in the [conq_python](https://github.com/UM-ARM-Lab/conq_python) repository.
